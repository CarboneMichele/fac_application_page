        <p>Born in 1993 in a beautiful area of southern Italy I grew up listening to the waves of the sea and a lot of music.</p>
        
        <p>I like being stimulated by new experiences and gaining new perspectives on things, therefore i love to explore both the world and my mind.</p> 
            
        <p>I consider myself a creative person, when I'm not travelling or daydreaming, you can find me reading books, playing guitar, listening to music or, more recently, programming.</p>

        <p>At the end of my Bachelor degree in Psychology, even though my interest in the subject was still alive, my intention to pursue this path from a professional point of view diminished more and more.</p>

        <p>So I moved to Padova, in northern Italy where I currently live, to get the Master degree in <span class="italic">Applied Cognitive Psychology</span>, a faculty that would allow me to apply my knowledge to areas that I think are more stimulating than the classic ones.</p>

        <p>Here I discovered the world of Human Computer Interaction and Cognitive Ergonomics and got familiar with the concepts of Usability and User Experience.</p>

        <p>The idea of ​​testing the UIs and designing them in such a way as to be the most usable and engaging fascinated me a lot, but after a while the curiosity about how to actually build an interface developed in me.</p>

        <div class="gif"></div>

        <p class="center"><span class="italic bold ">is how i met front-end development</span></p>

        <p>Since the first line of HTML I loved it. I think coding it’s one of the most rewarding things I’ve ever experienced, it's fun, challenging and keeps me constantly stimulated, which is awesome. 
        
        <p>My goal in the short-mid term is to deepen my knowledge in the field of web development, both front-end and back-end.</p>

        <p>My dream is to acquire enough skills to become a remote web developer and work while traveling around the world.</p>

    <article class="content">

        <div class="icon exit-icon">
            
        </div>

      
        <p>Shortly after taking my first steps in the world of <span class="italic bold">HTML</span> <span class="italic bold">CSS</span> and <span class="italic bold">JS</span>, helped mainly by FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy, Stack Overflow and some Youtube Channels, I realized that if I wanted to become serious in undertaking this path I would have to immerse myself totally in a <span class="italic">"coding environment”</span>.</p>

        <p>Specifically, what I thought was necessary to do was:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>meet people that share my desire to learn and grow together</p></li>
            <li><p>find a learning framework based on "learning-by-doing" and cooperation, which would allow you to learn by working on real projects</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>So I decided to move for a week to Turin to attend a mini-coding bootcamp called <span class="italic bold">"Turn into coders”</span>, held by the web developer Matteo Giaccone.</p>

        <p>And it was here that, during a conversation with Matteo concerning the origin of the bootcamp format, I discovered Founders And Coders.</p>

        <p>From the moment Matteo started describing FAC, the concept and the values behind it, being part of a FAC coort was set as my main objective and working at the prerequisites became part of my daily routine.</p>

        <p>The idea of ​​providing free education, guided by cooperative learning and based on real projects, together with the desire to help others using one of the most precious skills today, are the elements that made me appreciate FAC as a possible continuation of my "coding journey".</p>
        
        <p>FAC is definitely something that I want to be part of, I see it as an opportunity to grow under several point of views and hopefully as the next destination of my journey.</p>
